<h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">The Big Oak was the highlight of the trip. If there is anything you need to know about my friend Kate, is that she LOVES trees. She has an overwhelmingly thorough appreciation for their enchanted beauty. This historic 338 year old Southern Live Oak covered in Spanish moss and resurrection fern has been resilient to the years of weather and development and is simply astonishing. Walking beneath the massive limbs held up with cable ties over the sidewalk you can see the town clearly cares about preserving this beauty. The tree comes complete with a webcam attatched to a lamp post across the street to snap your pic from above the canopy. All you have to do is dial the number on the back of the sign and pose for the countdown. You can find your photos posted online on the Thomasville tourism website.</h3>
